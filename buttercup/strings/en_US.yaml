    Hey <@{user_id}>, you are now successfully registered as **/u/{username}**. Thank you!
  invalid_name: |
    Hey <@{user_id}>, it appears that your new server nickname is **not compliant** with our guidelines.

    It must have the format `/u/<reddit_username>`, where you replace `<reddit_username>` with your actual username.

    Hey <@{user_id}>, you seem to be missing the leading slash in your server nickname, but I don't have sufficient permissions to fix it for you!

  new_member: |
    Hello, <@{user_id}>! Welcome to the Transcribers of Reddit chill room! :wave:
    Please **adjust your server nickname** to match your Reddit username. This makes it easier for us to moderate the server.

    To do this on PC, **type `/nick /u/<reddit_username>`** in the chat.
    On mobile, tap the **hamburger menu** button on the upper left,  tap the **server name**,  tap "**Edit Server Profile**". Cheers!

      - Look who's slacking off.
      - Taking a break?
      - Transcribing a post would be a good start.
      - At that pace we're gonna be here a long time.
      - There are people who transcribe and there's u/{user}.
      - Not sure what you expected. You know exactly how much it is.
      - Slow and stead wins the race. Too bad this is not a race.
      - At least there are more posts for the others.

      - A good start, keep on going!
      - Don't worry, you'll get there eventually!
      - It's a long road, but a rewarding one!
      - '"After executing the `/progress` command, u/{user} claimed another post."'
      - Oh! Do it again!
      - More. MORE!
    25:
      - Go forth and conquer!
      - I see, the motivation is there!
      - One quarter done. Will the rest follow?
    50:
      - Halfway there!
      - The first half is done. Remember to take a break!
      - I'm a "progress bar is half full" kind of bot.
      - That's half of it. Wanna push on?
    75:
      - We're getting there, keep on going!
      - It's getting warmer, warmer...
      - Good human!
    95:
      - So close!
      - I can already *taste* victory!
      - Only a few more!
      - I can see the light at the end of the tunnel...
      - ":pinching_hand:"

      - "Done and dusted! Great job! :partying_face:"
      - "It's finally done! Congrats! :tada:"
      - '"Challenge? What challenge?", u/{user} said.'
      - The party will be at my place!
      - Pop the champagne, u/{user} did it!
      - I wish I could be as cool as u/{user}...
    105:
      - You're already finished. You can stop now.
      - It's addicting, isn't it?
    200:
      - u/{user}. We'll remember that name for a long time.
      - I thought I was the only bot here...
      - You can't split your 200/24 and give half of it to another user. Just thought I should clarify this.
      - Sometimes I ask myself how many cats u/{user} trained to make transcriptions for them.
    300:
      - Uhm. Please leave a few posts for the others...
    400:
      - Clearing the queue all by yourself?
      - I'm not a doctor, but I'm not sure how healthy this is...
    500:
      - Well. It finally happened. And of course it's u/{user}.
      - Is that a 500/24 or is the progress bar just happy to see me?
